[uComponents](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/backoffice-extensions/ucomponents) is an open and collaborative project for creating components for Umbraco (from v4.5 to v6.x) including data types, XSLT extensions, controls and more.

Containing over 30 data-types, 10 XSLT extension libraries, keyboard short-cuts, drag-n-drop functionality, as well as some great developer utilities - uComponents is one of the must-have packages for any (v4.5 to v6.x) Umbraco-powered website!
